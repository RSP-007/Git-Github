# 📘 Git, GitHub & Version Control

This repository explains the basics of **Version Control**, **Git**, and **GitHub**.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning how to manage and track code properly.

## 📌 What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that helps developers:

- Track changes in files
- Maintain history of modifications
- Work on projects safely
- Restore previous versions if needed
- Collaborate with others

It prevents overwriting work and keeps projects organized.

## 🛠 What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development.

### 🔹 Why Use Git?

- Tracks every change made in the project
- Allows multiple developers to work together
- Supports branching and merging
- Keeps complete project history

---

## 💻 Basic Git Commands

```bash
git init              # Initialize a new Git repository
git status            # Check repository status
git add .             # Add all files to staging area
git commit -m "msg"   # Save changes with a message
git log               # View commit history
git branch            # List all branches
git checkout branch   # Switch to another branch
git merge branch      # Merge a branch into current branch


🔗 Connecting Git to GitHub
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main



main
🌳 Branching Concept

Branching allows developers to:

Work on new features separately

Fix bugs without affecting main code

Merge changes safely

Example:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
📁 What is .gitignore?

.gitignore is a file used to tell Git which files or folders to ignore.

Example:

node_modules/
.env
*.log

This prevents unnecessary or sensitive files from being pushed to GitHub.

🚀 Why Git & GitHub Are Important

Maintains complete project history

Enables teamwork and collaboration

Prevents data loss

Industry-standard tool for developers

Essential for modern software development

📚 Summary

Version Control → Tracks changes in files

Git → Tool used for version control

GitHub → Platform to host and share Git repositories

✨ Learning Git and GitHub is a fundamental skill for every developer.
